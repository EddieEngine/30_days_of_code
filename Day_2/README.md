Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

Example
-------
meal cost   = 100
tip percent = 15
tax percent = 8

A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value 123 and return from the function.
